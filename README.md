 **Premier League Data Analysis: Unpacking the Shift in Home Advantage**

 **Overview**
This project dives into the fascinating world of football analytics, focusing on match data from the **Premier League**, **Carabao Cup**, and **FA Cup** during a season where teams competed without the roar of fans in the stadiums. Using advanced data cleaning techniques, DAX measures, and interactive visualizations, this project uncovers surprising trends in team performance and challenges the long-standing notion of home advantage.

 **Key Insights**

 **1. The Disappearing Home Advantage**
Traditionally, home teams have enjoyed a significant edge due to factors like fan support, familiarity with the pitch, and reduced travel fatigue. However, this season revealed a striking reversal: **away teams won more games than home teams**. This unusual trend can be attributed to the absence of fans in stadiums, which removed the psychological and tactical boost home teams typically rely on.

 **Why Did Away Teams Thrive?**
- **No Crowd Pressure**: Without fans, home teams lost the intimidating atmosphere that often unsettles away teams.
- **Neutralized Environment**: Away teams faced less hostility and pressure, making it easier to play their natural game.
- **Tactical Adjustments**: Managers and players adapted to the lack of crowd influence, leveling the playing field.

 **2. Goals vs. Wins: The Home Team Paradox**
Despite winning fewer games, **home teams scored more goals overall**. This highlights an intriguing imbalance:
- Home teams maintained dominance in terms of possession and attacking play.
- However, they struggled to convert this dominance into wins, possibly due to a lack of motivation or tactical complacency without fan support.

 **3. Broader Implications**
The findings suggest that fan presence is a critical factor in football outcomes, influencing not just morale but also tactical decisions and player performance. This season serves as a unique case study in how external factors can reshape the dynamics of the game.

**Methodology**
- **Data Sources**: Match data from the Premier League, Carabao Cup, and FA Cup.
- **Tools Used**: Power BI for interactive dashboards, DAX for advanced measures, and Python/Pandas for data cleaning.
- **Process**:
  1. Cleaned and preprocessed raw match data to ensure accuracy.
  2. Created DAX measures to calculate key performance metrics (e.g., win rates, goals scored, home vs. away performance).
  3. Built interactive visualizations to explore trends and present findings.



 **Why This Matters**
This project isn’t just about numbers—it’s about understanding how external factors like fan presence can fundamentally alter the dynamics of a sport. The insights gained here could help teams, analysts, and fans better appreciate the psychological and tactical nuances of football, especially in unprecedented situations like games played behind closed doors.



 **How to Explore the Project**

- **Code and Data**: Check out the scripts and datasets used for cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- **Key Visualizations**: Explore charts and graphs that highlight home vs. away performance, goal trends, and more.


**Conclusion**
The absence of fans during this season turned football norms on their head, giving us a rare glimpse into the true impact of crowd support on the game. This project not only highlights the importance of data-driven analysis in sports but also underscores the unpredictable nature of football—a game where even the smallest changes can lead to big surprises.
